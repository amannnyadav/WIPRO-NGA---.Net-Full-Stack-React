//In C#.NET We use Exception Handling for handling errors and exceptions in a controlled manner.
//With E.H we can gracefully handle runtime errors, maintain program stability, and provide meaningful feedback to users.
//hence Below staeps are used to implement Exception Handling in C#.NET
//in .NET There is gloabl exception class called System.Exception from where all exception classes are derived.
//hence .NET follows herirachal exception handling mechanism. Where base class are used to catch general exceptions and derived classes are used to catch specific exceptions.
//ex : System.IO.IOException is derived from System.Exception class.
//ex: System.DivideByZeroException is derived from System.ArithmeticException which is derived from System.Exception class.

//Common sceanrio where exception handling is used in C#.NET
//1. File I/O Operations: Handling exceptions when reading from or writing to files.
//2. Database Operations: Handling exceptions during database connections and queries.
//3. Network Communications: Handling exceptions during network requests and responses.
//4. User Input Validation: Handling exceptions when parsing and validating user inputs.
//5. Resource Management: Ensuring proper release of resources like file handles, database connections etc. using finally block or using statement.
//6. API Calls: Handling exceptions when calling external APIs or services.
//7. Multithreading: Handling exceptions in multi-threaded applications to prevent crashes and ensure thread safety.
//8. Configuration Management: Handling exceptions when reading configuration settings from files or environment variables.
//9. Data Serialization/Deserialization: Handling exceptions when converting data to/from formats like JSON, XML etc.
//10. Custom Exception Handling: Creating and handling custom exception classes for specific application scenarios.

 //Any class that derives from System.Exception is considered an exception class in C#.NET.
//If any child class inherits from DailyLimitExceededException, it will also be considered an exception class.
//hence we can create a hierarchy of exception classes in C#.NET by deriving custom exception classes from existing exception classes.
